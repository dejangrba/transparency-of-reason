# The Transparency of Reason

## The Ethical Issues of AI Art

#### [GitHub Page](https://dejangrba.github.io/transparency-of-reason/)

### Abstract

The ethical problems of AI science, technology, and business are essential but elusive, their implications difficult to predict, and their fallouts hard to handle by both the immediate actors and the public. Among many other factors, they affect the creative space of contemporary AI art. In this chapter, we provide a critical outlook on the ethical issues of AI art. After summarizing the pertinent ambiguities of a broader techno-cultural context, we discuss AI art’s specific ethical issues focusing on the sociocultural vectors, expressive strategies, and market directives whose critical understanding is crucial for the advancement of the field.

**Keywords:** Art, Artificial Intelligence, Computational Arts, Digital Culture, Ethics, Machine Learning, Poetics.
